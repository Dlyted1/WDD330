        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it is  defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses</li>
          <li>Property is a way for us to get certain meta information about an object. Variables and arrays are a type of object.
