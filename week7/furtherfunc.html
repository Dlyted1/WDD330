        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE:  (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it is  defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses

            </li>
                     
          <li>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves: The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.
          </li>

          <li>
            Recursive Function: is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved. A common example is a function that calculates the factorial of a number. ie Russian Matryoshka Dolls Example
          </li>

          <li>
            JavaScript Promises "I Promise a Result!"<br>
            "Producing code" is code that can take some time "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result. A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code.<br>
            Promise Object Properties<br>
            A JavaScript Promise object can be:<br>
            Pending<br>
            Fulfilled<br>
            Rejected<br> 
            The Promise object supports two properties: state and result. While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined. When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value. When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
          </li>
          <li>Asynchronous JavaScript - "I will finish later!" Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous. A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()
          </li>
          <li>
            Closures are one of JavaScript’s most powerful features - JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope. Global variables can be made local (private) with closures. In a web page, global variables belong to the window object.<br>

            Global variables can be used (and changed) by all scripts in the page (and in the window). A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code.<br>

            Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other.<br>

            A closure is formed when a function returns another function that then maintains access to any variables created in the original functions scope. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Functional programming uses pure functions as the building blocks of a program. The ability to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use anonymous functions and closures, are all fundamental elements of functional programming that JavaScript excels at.
