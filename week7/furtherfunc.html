        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE:  (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it is  defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses

            </li>
                     
          <li>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves: The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.
          </li>

          <li>
            Recursive Function: is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. Itâ€™s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved. A common example is a function that calculates the factorial of a number. ie Russian Matryoshka Dolls Example
