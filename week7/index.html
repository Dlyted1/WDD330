        <ol>
          <li>
            For the Hiking Complete in our team activity we were able to get the comment buttons but on my code it does not appear - even went back through the completed code - thoughts on why it's not appearing?
          </li><br>
          <li>Can 'touchend'  and  'click' be used together in JavaScript? The touchend in the Hikes Activity was changed to 'click' but how does that work then when the 'touchend' is removed for those using touch on tablet or mobile?
